Speeding motorcycle, won't you change me?
Speeding motorcycle, won't you change me?
In a world of funny changes
Speeding motorcycle, won't you change me?
Speeding motorcycle of my heart
Speeding motorcycle; always changing me
Speeding motorcycle, don't you drive recklessly
Speeding motorcycle of my heart
Pretty girls have taken you for a ride
Hurt you deep inside but you never slowed down
Speeding motorcycle in my heart
Speeding motorcycle, let's speed smart
'Cause we don't want to wreck but
We can do a lot of tricks
We don't have to break our necks
To get our kicks
